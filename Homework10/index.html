            <p>Through this scatter plot, you can gain valuable insights into the global impact of COVID-19. Each bubble represents a country, with its size indicating the population size, while the X-axis represents the number of confirmed cases, and the Y-axis shows the number of deaths.</p>
            <p>Firstly, you can readily discern the significant variations in the severity of the pandemic across different countries. Larger bubbles typically correspond to countries with higher populations, but the numbers of confirmed and death cases also vary due to various factors. This aids in understanding the diverse challenges that different nations face in dealing with the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you can compare the relationship between confirmed cases and death cases among countries. This helps identify which countries have successfully controlled the pandemic and which ones are facing greater challenges.</p>
            <p>Lastly, by utilizing the slider to filter population ranges and the dropdown menu to select specific WHO regions, you can precisely compare and categorize the data for a more in-depth understanding. This chart is instrumental in providing a nuanced comprehension of the global impact of COVID-19 and offers invaluable information for decision-makers to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.</p>
